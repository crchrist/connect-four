# Connect Four

Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.

# HOW TO PLAY

1. Decide who plays first. Players will alternate turns after playing the first piece.

2. On your turn, place one of you pieces in ANY of the slots by selecting one of the columns on the grid. 

3. Play alternates until one player gets FOUR pieces of his or her color in a row. The four in a row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

# HOW TO WIN

If you are the first player to get four of your pieces in a row, you win the game!
