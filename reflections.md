1. Yesterday I got almost all of the styling I want to have done for the game. I am very happy with the presentation of the game at this point. 
2. Goals for today is to complete the readme file and to create/implement the instructions for the game onto the page. Additional goal is to clear blocker(see below).
3. Currently when the game has been won, the winning players color can continue to be played to fill up the remainder of the board. I have been unable to prevent this from happening.

- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. While working to resolve yesterdays blocker, I found that one of the diagonal checks was not functioning properly, causing the game to continue even though four in a row was completed. I was able to debug this issue. I was also able to implement the instructions to the page via a popup button.  
2. Today I would like to complete the blocker for yesterday as I was not able to get that completed. I would also like to implement media sizing to the page.  
3. The blocker today is the same as yesterday as I found a new blocker while trying to fix the previous one. Yesterday I found that one of the diagnoal checks was not being implemented and allowing the game to continue even though four-in-a-row had been accomplished. This took priority yesterday and was completed.
