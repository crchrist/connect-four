# Proposal of Game

The game that I will be creating is a simplistic version of Connect 4 Four. If you are unfamiliar (shame on you), the game has a 6 by 7 vertical playing field. Two players will alternate turns by placing a game piece in a selected column. The piece always goes to the bottom of the column. In order to win the game one player must create a line of four game pieces. This line can be created horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  

This game will meet all the following requirements of the assignment: 

* Display a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS \(Keep It Simple Stupid\) and   DRY \(Don't Repeat Yourself\) principles
* Use Javascript** for DOM manipulation
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it\*\*
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS \(adhere to best practices\)
